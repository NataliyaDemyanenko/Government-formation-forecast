Government Formation Forecast App//
Overview
The Government Formation Forecast App is a tool designed to predict government coalition structure and power distribution within a government coalition based on the results of parliamentary elections or public opinion polls. 
It utilizes a cooperative game theory approach to provide empirically accurate forecasts of two aspects of the government formation process: which political parties will form a government coalition and the distribution of power within that coalition.

Features
Input Data: Accepts shares of votes received in parliamentary elections or levels of support in public opinion polls.
Constraints Handling: Considers credible commitments between each pair of political parties that preclude cooperation in the government formation process.
Output: Predicts the government formation process, in particular, which parties will form a coalition and how the power will be distributed.

Methodology
The algorithm utilizes the conditional Shapley value.
