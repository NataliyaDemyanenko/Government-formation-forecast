Government Formation Forecast App<br />
Overview<br />
The Government Formation Forecast App is a tool designed to predict government coalition structure and power distribution within a government coalition based on the results of parliamentary elections or public opinion polls. <br />
It utilizes a cooperative game theory approach to provide empirically accurate forecasts of two aspects of the government formation process: which political parties will form a government coalition and the distribution of power within that coalition.<br />

Features<br />
Input Data: Accepts shares of votes received in parliamentary elections or levels of support in public opinion polls.<br />
Constraints Handling: Considers credible commitments between each pair of political parties that preclude cooperation in the government formation process.<br />
Output: Predicts the government formation process, in particular, which parties will form a coalition and how the power will be distributed.<br />

Methodology<br />
The algorithm utilizes the conditional Shapley value.<br />

Usage<br />
Prepare Input Data: Format your input data to include the shares of votes received or levels of support in public opinion polls and the bilateral constraints between political parties.<br />
Run the Forecast: Use the app to input your data and generate a prediction of the government structure and power distribution.<br />
Review Output: Analyze the predicted government coalition and the distribution of ministry posts among the participating parties.<br />

Example<br />

# Example input<br />
vote_shares = {<br />
    'Party A': 30,<br />
    'Party B': 25,<br />
    'Party C': 20,<br />
    'Party D': 15,<br />
    'Party E': 10<br />
}

constraints = [<br />
    ('Party A', 'Party D'),<br />
    ('Party B', 'Party E')<br />
]<br />
